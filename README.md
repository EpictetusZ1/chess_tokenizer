## About

A simple CLI tool to learn and practice Rust, designed to be a chess opening book. The app shows frequencies of moves at a given depth, allowing for traversal down and up the tree.

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:EpictetusZ1/opening_tree.git
   ```
   
2. üìÇ Navigate to the project directory on your local machine
   ```shell

    ```
   
3. Use either `cargo build` or `cargo run` to start the opening book
4. Enter a chess game file (PGN) to start the opening book
5. Navigate down the tree by entering the desired move, `..` to go back up, or `exit` to exit the program
